Blockchain-Based Cryptocurrency Web Application
Description
This project is a web application that simulates a cryptocurrency platform powered by a blockchain. Users can register, log in, and perform cryptocurrency transactions, such as sending money to others or purchasing cryptocurrency. 
All transactions are recorded on a blockchain, ensuring security and integrity through cryptographic hashing.
The platform is built using Python, Flask, and MySQL, providing a user-friendly interface for managing accounts and transactions.

Blockchain-Powered Transactions: Users can send cryptocurrency to other users, with transactions recorded as blocks on the blockchain.
Buying Cryptocurrency: Users can buy cryptocurrency, with the purchase recorded on the blockchain.
Account Balance: Users can view their account balance, calculated from blockchain data.
Session Management: Secure session handling for user login and logout.
Database Integration: MySQL is used to store user information and blockchain data.
